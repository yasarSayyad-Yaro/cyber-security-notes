#MY THOUGHTS

Cybersecurity is not a perfectly structured path — it’s an open ocean with many islands, each representing a domain.
As a beginner, you should pick one island first (like web hacking), learn the basics, and see if it resonates with you.
Once you gain depth, explore other domains too.
The beauty of cybersecurity lies in exploring, experimenting, and discovering what excites you the most.
