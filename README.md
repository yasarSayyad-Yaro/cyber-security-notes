# 🛡️ Web Penetration Testing Notes

### *TryHackMe – Jr Penetration Tester Path + Additional Pentesting Resources*

Welcome to my personal repository documenting my journey through the **TryHackMe Jr Penetration Tester Path**.
This repo is a structured collection of my notes, walkthroughs, screenshots, and findings while learning **web hacking**, **recon**, **enumeration**, **manual testing**, and other pentesting techniques.

I will continue to expand this repository with:

* 🔹 Notes from THM rooms
* 🔹 Personal findings & observations
* 🔹 External resources (blogs, tools, payloads)
* 🔹 Cheatsheets for web exploitation
* 🔹 My own experiments in pentesting topics

This repo is both my **learning journal** and a **reference guide** for anyone beginning their cybersecurity journey.

* Key takeaways
* Payloads
* Mitigation notes (AppSec perspective)


## 🔧 **Tools & Techniques Covered**

Throughout this journey, I am learning and documenting:

* Web enumeration (gobuster, ffuf, dirsearch)
* Manual recon using browser DevTools
* Parameter tampering
* BurpSuite basics
* Authentication attacks
* File inclusion vulnerabilities
* SSRF, XSS, SQLi
* Race conditions
* Command injection
* Basic red-team mindset
* Finding hints manually in source code
* Understanding web architecture
